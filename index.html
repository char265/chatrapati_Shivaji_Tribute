                <p>
                    <b>Shivaji</b> (born February 19, 1630, or April 1627, Shivner, Poona [now Pune],
                     India—died April 3, 1680, Raigad) opposed the Mughal dynasty and founded the Maratha kingdom in 17th-century India. 
                     His kingdom’s security was based on religious toleration and on the functional integration of Brahmans, Marathas, and Prabhus.
                     Shivaji was descended from a line of prominent nobles. India at the time of his birth, in 1630, was under Muslim rule: 
                     the Mughals in the north and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur and Golconda in the south. All three ruled by right of conquest,
                      with no pretense that they had any obligations toward those who they ruled. Shivaji, whose ancestral estates were situated in the Deccan, 
                      in the realm of the Bijapur sultans, found the Muslim oppression and religious persecution of the Hindus so intolerable that,
                       by the time he was 16, he convinced himself that he 
                     was the divinely appointed instrument of the cause of Hindu freedom—a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his life.
